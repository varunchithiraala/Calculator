# Simple Calculator

## Overview

The Simple Calculator is a Python-based graphical calculator application developed using the `tkinter` library. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and includes advanced features such as exponentiation, square roots, and the ability to handle large numbers with comma separation. It provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for digits, operators, and special functions.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Operations:** Exponentiation and square root.
- **Comma Separation:** Automatically formats large numbers with commas for better readability.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean layout with easy-to-use buttons and clear display.
